**I Might Be Wrong** is the my brainchild. I'm a dysfunctional adult who is fueled by caffeine and self-loathing. I'm a lovable loser just like Charlie Brown. When I'm not trying to fake it as a writer, I likes to get drunk while listening to José José. I hope to adopt a dog and names him Gatsby.

I graduated from **[The University of Texas at El Paso](https://www.utep.edu)** with a degree in English and American Literature. I'm co-founder and co-owner of **[Unlucky Eleven](https://unluckyeleven.com)**, an online retailer of vintage soccer jersey.
