I decided to start this blog with a single goal in mind: to write to organize my ideas. Maybe, it's a vague idea at best, but I do believe that along the way I will figure out things. 

The important matter is to write. Nothing else matters. But what good writing for the sake of writing can do for me? Well, what I hope to get from this blog is to have a place where I can let my thoughts and feelings out of my head and to run free on the endless web. It might sound like a lot of bullshit, but that's what a blog is for. To get lost in the Internet.

Hopefully, as I write things will start making sense. People start writing because they want to say something. For me, I found it to be true, however, I'm not sure what I want to say. Figuring it out while writing is part of the fun, and that's where the beauty of writing lies.

While I embark in this "adventure", I hope you, who might laugh while reading this, can be part of this journey. 

See you soon!
