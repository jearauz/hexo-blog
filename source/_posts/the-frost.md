It was in the beginning of the pandemic when I discovered the music of August Burns Red, and instantly I became fan of their music. Liking their music was something new for me because it forced me to venture into a genre that wasn't my cup of tea.

As I mentioned above, I wasn't fan of metalcore, and despite getting into heavy music growing up, I completely avoided metalcore and other genre related. The reason behind that was that I wasn't fan of the screaming-singing style. I mean how can I like a song if I could understand the lyric? However, now I look back and reflect of who I was, I can admit I was a total music snob back then. I though I was so cool because I was super into classic rock. My first iPod was filled out with the likes of Led Zeppelin, The Rolling Stones, The Beatles; pretty much everything from the 60s to the 80s that have cool guitar playing was my jam. Everything out of that wasn't worth listening.

August Burns Red are considered by both fans and critics as one of the most important band of the metalcore scene, and with almost 20 years of career, they don't show signs of slowing down anything soon.
